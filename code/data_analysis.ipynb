       " 'conversation_history': 'Tutor: Hi, could you please provide a step-by-step solution for the question below? The question is: Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. He also went for a short jog around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. How many steps did Elliott take during his jog?\\xa0\\n\\xa0Student: Elliott finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, so he took 10,000/2 = 5000 steps during these walks.\\nAdding the 1,000 steps he took with his friend, he has taken 5000+1000 = 6000 steps.\\nSubtracting 6000 from his goal of 10,000, he has 10,000-6000 = 4000 steps left to take.\\nTherefore, he took 4000 steps during his jog.\\xa0\\n\\xa04000\\xa0\\n\\xa0Tutor: can you tell me how you got to your answer?\\xa0\\n\\xa0Student: Sure. I started by figuring out how many steps Elliott had taken before his jog. I knew he had finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school so I calculated that he had taken 10000/2 = 5000 steps during these walks. Then I added the 1000 steps he took with his friend so I had taken 5000+1000 = 6000 steps. After that I subtracted 6000 from his goal of 10000 so I had 10000-6000 = 4000 steps left to take.
